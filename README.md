FIWARE-Enabled Autonomous Transport System (FEATS) is a project whose scope is automated material transport within a production facility using an Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR). This repository contains an executable of the LATTE component, a service which interacts with CoFFEE and FI-BREW in order to send orders to the AMR, using FIROS.

Despite being a component of the FEATS project, the LATTE source code is proprietary and therefore this repository is simply used to hold the executable for tutorial and testing purposes.

To find out more about FEATS, check the [documentation](https://feats-dih2.readthedocs.io/) and the [repository](https://github.com/Dalma-Systems/FEATS).
